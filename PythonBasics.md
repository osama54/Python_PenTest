#### Is python working on linux or windows: NO 
##### It is working based on interpretor, interpretor فاصل between the code and operating system
##### Compiler: It is code that convert the code to code that Operating system can understand and respond ( program will work on specific OS)

### Interpretor: the program will work on all platform, interpretor define the OS 

#### we have two type of python have different instruction:
##### python 2.7:  work as statement (end of support)
##### python 3:  work as functions 

#### Python IDLE: Tool can be used for python scripting, but not recommended (Cannot define the errors). 

#### it is better to use Python IDE or use text editor like: Notepad++ or sublime.

#### Pycharm IDE: very good environement for python programming. 

#### python pip: python installer package: use it when need to install a new Library.

#### Pylint library: Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
##### Pylint can infer actual values from your code using its internal code representation (astroid).
